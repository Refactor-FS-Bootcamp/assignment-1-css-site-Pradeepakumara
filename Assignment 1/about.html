            <h1>Web Design Agency</h1>
            <p>As stated earlier, web design focuses on the look and feel of a website and it’s supporting pages.  A web design agency will likely have a professional graphic designer (or team of them) working on logos, color schemes, branding, and any content you’ll be producing to make sure it adheres to your tastes. Software such as Adobe Photoshop is a key ingredient to producing quality graphic design services.</p>

                <h1>Front End Development</h1>
                <p><code>The front end stack is made up of many different languages and libraries. While these vary from application to application, there are only a few generic languages understood by all web browsers. These three main front-end coding languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</code></p>
                <p><code>Together, they create the underlying scaffolding that web browsers use to render the web pages that we interact with every day. All other libraries and front-end engineering are built upon these three main languages, which makes them must-have skills for any front-end developer.</code></p>
                <p><code>In fact, you can think of a webpage like a house. The initial UX design is the blueprint. HTML is the basic structure of the house. The CSS is the paint, fixtures, and other aesthetic decisions that make the house look attractive. And finally, JavaScript is the inner workings of the house (lights, heating, water) that we, the owner or renter, use and enjoy.</code></p>

                <h1>Back End Development</h1>
                <p><code>The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one or more programming languages. The back end is also called the data access layer of software or hardware and includes any functionality that needs to be accessed and navigated to by digital means.</code></p>
                <p><code>The layer above the back end is the front end and it includes all software or hardware that is part of a user interface. Human or digital users interact directly with various aspects of the front end of a program, including user-entered data, buttons, programs, websites and other features. Most of these features are designed by user experience (UX) professionals to be accessible, pleasant and easy to use.</code></p>

                <h1>Full Stack Development</h1>
                <p><code>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.</code></p>
                <p><code>Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete or add items in cart, change their profile, and do many other things. All these actions require a front-end user interface (UI), as well as some business logic, written in the back-end.</code></p>
                <p><code>Full stack developers must have knowledge of an entire technology stack, i.e., the set of technologies that are used to build an end-to-end application quickly and efficiently. For example, if they want to build an application using the MEAN stack, they should know how to work with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.</code></p>
